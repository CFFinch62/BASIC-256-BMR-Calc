# BASIC-256-BMR-Calc
Console and GUI apps for BMR Calculation

Console app is complete and works in the text window only.

GUI app is an attempt to create an event driven gui app with BASIC-256.
GUI is created as most of the helper files, Actual calulations are not completed.
They can be copied in from console verison fairly easily.
Have fun!
